You are a strawberry!

You are the Gryffindor of fruits.

Everyone loves you, and you are the life of the party. You are sweet, juicy, and a little bit tart.

You are the first friend anyone thinks of when they need a pick-me-up.

You are reliable, and you always know how to make people smile.

You taste great in everything, from smoothies to salads to desserts.

You mold easily, so you need to be careful about who you hang out with.

You are a little sensitive, but you are also a little tough.
