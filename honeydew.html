You are a honeydew! Not everyone knows exactly what to do with you, so they just put you in a fruit salad.

You are a bit bitter. People regularly mistake you for a cantaloupe, but you are not the same. You are a little more reserved and not as sweet.

You are a little more subtle, and you have a unique flavor that some people love and others don't quite understand.

You are a bit of an acquired taste, but those who appreciate you know that you are worth the effort.

Sometimes you feel overshadowed by your more popular counterparts, but you would make an acceptable road trip buddy if you had to.
