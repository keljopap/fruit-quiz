You are a pomegranate.  You're so freaking stubborn.

Like what gives you the right to taste so good but take twenty minutes to eat?

You are a little bit of a diva, and you know it. You are a little extra, but you are worth the effort.

Well, maybe not on a weekday but on a Saturday night, you are the life of the party.

You really hate to work.  You are a little lazy and prefer to take it easy.

You are not afraid to indulge in the finer things in life, and you know how to treat yourself.

You are a little bit of a show-off, but you are also a little bit of a tease.

You are a little bit of a wild card, and you never know what to expect from you.
