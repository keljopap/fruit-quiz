You are a pineapple! You are a little prickly on the outside, but you have a heart of gold.

You also have a bad reputation for being a little unhinged and too forward in social situations.

You are more reserved than they give you credit for, but you are not afraid to speak your mind.

You seem almost impossible to get to know, but once you let someone in, you are a loyal friend for a few days.

You taste good grilled in a kabob or even on pizza, but people doubt you.

You continue to shock and amaze people with your unconventional but intentional flavor pairings.
