You are a grape! You always roll deep. You don't know how to be alone.

You are a social butterfly, and you thrive in the company of others.

You taste better frozen.

You bring the world many great things, like wine and jelly.

People feel conflicted about you because of the whole raisin thing, but you don't let that get to you.

You are a great friend and always know how to have a good time.
