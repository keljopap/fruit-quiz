You are a watermelon, bro.

You are the Hufflepuff of fruits.

You are sweet, juicy, and a little bit crunchy. You are the perfect summer fruit, and you always know how to make people smile.

Most people think you are a little too big to be a fruit, but you are just the right size for a picnic.

You make a great margarita.

You may be tough to carry around, but you are worth the effort.

You are super into fashion, and you always know how to make a statement.
