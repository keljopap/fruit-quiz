You are a lemon... 

Sorry to say, but you are a little sour. You are a bit of a loner and prefer to keep to yourself.

You are a little tart and have a sharp wit that can catch people off guard. You are not afraid to speak your mind, but sometimes you can come off as a bit harsh.

You are a little misunderstood, but those who take the time to get to know you appreciate your unique flavor.

You are a little zesty and have a refreshing personality that can brighten up even the dullest days.

You are easy to find in a grocery store, but you are not always the first choice for a fruit salad.

You are often used as a garnish or in drinks, but you have a lot to offer on your own.

People should eat more lemons on their own because you are a great source of vitamin C and can add a burst of flavor to any dish.

0/10 dentists recommend you, but you are a great addition to any recipe.
