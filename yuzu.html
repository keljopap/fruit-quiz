You are yuzu!

You are a bit of a prankster, and you love to have fun.

You are a little bit of a rebel, and you love to break the rules.

You are rarely eaten on your own, but you are a great addition to any dish.

You prefer to be used in a sauce or dressing, and you are often used to add a little zing to a dish.

You love to keep people on their toes, and you are always up for a good time.

You are brave and you will try anything once.
